- There is an outlier which show maximum steps 35,000. It could be an error in recording steps.
- On average, the users are burning approx. 2,000 calories but the result varies. If we analyze 15,000 steps, the calories burning amount range from 2,000 to 4,000. This variety in burning calories occur due to Very Active, Fairly Active and Lightly Active User.

### User Experience Design


#### Blog Post

- Daily short articles and blogs can be published on the app where harmful effects of an unhealthy lifestyle can be shared such as having effects of having highly Sedentary time, and lack of sleep can be shared. Also, recommendations should be given on how users can change their unhealthy habits with small steps and stay consistent in their journey. These kinds of things help their targeted audience adopt healthy habits.

#### Notification Alerts

Notifications alerts should be displayed on the users' phones to remind them if they are inactive or sitting in an idle position for more than 2 hours to have a little or remind the recommended sleep time to the user. Such notifications will help the users to stay consistent and remindful about following healthy habits.
